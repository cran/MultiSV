Description: MultiSV is an R package for identification of structural
    variations in multiple populations based on whole genome resequencing. It
    fits linear mixed model and identifies structural variations in multiple
    populations using whole genome sequencing data. It could also be
    manipulated to use on RNA-seq data for differential gene expression
    (implementation in future releases). Main steps for analysis include
    generating read depth in bins using ComputeBinCounts. conversion of bins to
    MultiSV format using Bin2MultiSV. Finally, identification of structural
    variations using CallMultiSV.
